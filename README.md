# ByteLiteSysDetect
Utility for collecting system information

This module builds a static `.lib` on Windows and `.a` on other platforms.
It reports CPU details, core counts, RAM, OS version, SIMD features, drive
speed, GPU name and bitness. A diagnostic function prints all values using
ASCII-only output.
