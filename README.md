# ByteLiteSysDetect
Utility For Local System Detection

This static library gathers extended system information including CPU name,
core counts, RAM, OS details, SIMD feature flags, drive performance, GPU
name, and bitness. It exposes a `SystemProfile` struct and a simple
`RunSystemDetectionTest` function that prints collected data.
